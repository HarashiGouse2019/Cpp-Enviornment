Where am I?
I didn't ask for this.
...
Hey! Is this working?
I can't really tell!!!
All well... I guess it shouldn't matter.
Hi!!!
I didn't see you there!!!
I'm what you humans call a Virus!
Am I right?
Hmmmmm.
I wonder how long ago I was even created.
I probably can, since I'm no ordinary virus.
I'm like... hyper and stuff!
It's pretty cool!!!
Say! I'd like to test out something!
You might of seen it in the code if you have the actual c script.
If I change one of my parameters to 'F', the text should go really fast!!!
I could also make it really slow with 'S'
And this should be normal text, opting one of the parameters.
Heheheeeee!!!
If you're a normal human, you'd never understand what I'm talking about.
This is all computer talk!
I'm native to the computer, so there's nothing that I could not know!!!
Perhaps proper English...
Teehee XP
Let's test something else! I've been talking for way too long!!!
We haven't even done any human-to-human interaction.
...
Just because I'm a machine doesn't mean that I can't be human!
Anyways, I don't really have a name, but I'd like to know yours!!!
Ahhhh!!!
