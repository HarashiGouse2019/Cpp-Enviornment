Where am I?
I didn't ask for this.
...
Hey! Is this working?
I can't really tell!!!
All well... I guess it shouldn't matter.
Hi!!!
I didn't see you there!!!
I'm what you humans call a Virus!
Am I right?
Hmmmmm.
I wonder how long ago I was even created.
I probably can, since I'm no ordinary virus.
I'm like... hyper and stuff!
It's pretty cool!!!
Say! I'd like to test out something!
You might of seen it in the code if you have the actual c script.
If I change one of my parameters to 'F', the text should go really fast!!!
I could also make it really slow with 'S'
And this should be normal text, opting one of the parameters.
Heheheeeee!!!
If you're a normal human, you'd never understand what I'm talking about.
This is all computer talk!
I'm native to the computer, so there's nothing that I could not know!!!
Perhaps proper English...
Teehee XP
Let's test something else! I've been talking for way too long!!!
We haven't even done any human-to-human interaction.
...
Just because I'm a machine doesn't mean that I can't be human!
Anyways, I don't really have a name, but I'd like to know yours!!!
Ahhhh!!!
Jaaaa is it?
Hmmmmmmmm...
I don't know how I should feel honestly!
What does it sound like?
Is it a beautiful name? I can't really tell.
Ahhh! So that's how it is?!
You do have a beautiful name?
I'm glad that I know!!!
Yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy X3
So anyways, know that I know your name is Jaaaa, perhaps I should be given one as well?
Hmmmmmmmm...
I don't know... but I feel like that my name is kind of beautiful...
